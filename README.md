# SPOT ROBOT DOG (By AEA from PoliMI)
This project is an open-source version of a robot dog, complete with an advanced training environment and custom controller logic. The project aims to train a robot dog using RL (specifically the PPO algorithm) and plans to support multiple backends for simulation, from PyBullet and MuJoCo to Gazebo, Unity, or Unreal Engine.

We plan to develop our own platform and algorithms for training while supporting the full stack of software necessary to port the simulation to a real robot (ROS); everything will have a Python interface. We are actively developing it, so expect frequent updates.

Thanks to the authors of the [Spot Micro](https://spotmicroai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) project for the CAD models. With love from [AEA](https://www.aeapolimi.it/) (Automation Engineering Association) of Polytechnic University of Milan.
