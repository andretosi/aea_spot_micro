    "> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT WARNING** ⚠️  \n",

    "## Contents\n",
    "This directory includes:\n",
    "- This notebook  \n",
    "- The file `reward_function.py`, which defines a reward function tailored for achieving standing behaviour with deep reinforcement learning  \n",
    "- `ppo_stand.zip`, a pretrained policy that demonstrates standing behaviour  \n",
    "- Three config files (`env`, `agent`, and `terrain` configs) that specify all parameters for this experiment. In particular, note the definition of the **home positions** of each joint in `agentConfig.yaml`, since these determine the pose the robot assumes when resting  \n",
    "- `stand.pkl`, a state file produced at the end of a training session. It is used by the environment to store necessary data such as the total number of training steps  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The file `SpotmicroEnv.py` defines the custom training environment. For the notebook to work, it must be located in the *grandparent directory* of this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use\n",
    "This notebook, along with the directory contents, demonstrates the basic workflow of training and testing a simple policy.  \n",
    "It also serves as documentation, since this policy will be used as a foundation for later experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is organized as follows:\n",
    "- The first cell (imports) must be executed every time; it loads almost all dependencies  \n",
    "- The first section covers training a custom policy.  \n",
    "  - To experiment, copy this directory elsewhere and adjust the reward function or hyperparameters there  \n",
    "  - Otherwise, you can stick to the provided base policy and skip directly to testing  \n",
    "- The final section covers testing: exploring the results and analyzing the learned policy  \n"
